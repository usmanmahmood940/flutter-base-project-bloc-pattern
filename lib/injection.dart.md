### Introduction

This code snippet demonstrates how to set up dependency injection using the `GetIt` package in a Flutter application. Dependency injection is a powerful technique that helps decouple different parts of your application, making it easier to test, maintain, and scale.

### Dependency Injection Setup

The code uses the `GetIt` package to implement dependency injection.  `GetIt` is a simple and widely used dependency injection framework for Flutter.

**The `init()` function is responsible for registering all the dependencies:**

```dart
final locator = GetIt.instance;

void init() {
  // ... register dependencies ...
}
```

**`locator` is a global instance of `GetIt` that provides access to registered dependencies.**

#### Data Sources

*  **`AuthenticationRemoteDataSourceImpl`:** This class is responsible for fetching data from a remote source (e.g., an API) related to authentication. It's registered as a lazy singleton, meaning that it will only be created when it's first requested.
    ```dart
    final authRemoteDataSource = AuthenticationRemoteDataSourceImpl();
    locator.registerLazySingleton<AuthenticationRemoteDataSource>(
      () => authRemoteDataSource,
    );
    ```

#### Repositories

*  **`AuthenticationRepositoryImpl`:** This class acts as an intermediary between the UI and the data source. It fetches data from the `AuthenticationRemoteDataSource` and provides a clean interface for the UI to interact with. It's also registered as a lazy singleton.
    ```dart
    final authRepository = AuthenticationRepositoryImpl(locator());
    locator.registerLazySingleton<AuthenticationRepository>(
      () => authRepository,
    );
    ```

#### Use Cases

* **`SignIn`:** This class encapsulates the logic for signing in a user. It takes the `AuthenticationRepository` as a dependency to interact with authentication data. It's also registered as a lazy singleton.
    ```dart
    final signIn = SignIn(locator());
    locator.registerLazySingleton(
      () => signIn,
    );
    ```

#### BLoCs & Cubits

* **`AuthenticatorWatcherBloc`:** This BLoC (Business Logic Component) is responsible for monitoring the authentication state of the user. It is also registered as a lazy singleton.
    ```dart
    final authenticatorWatcherBloc = AuthenticatorWatcherBloc();
    locator.registerLazySingleton(
      () => authenticatorWatcherBloc,
    );
    ```

* **`SignInFormBloc`:** This BLoC manages the state of the sign-in form, handling user input and validation. It takes the `SignIn` use case as a dependency to handle the actual sign-in process. It's also registered as a lazy singleton.
    ```dart
    final signInFormBloc = SignInFormBloc(locator());
    locator.registerLazySingleton(
      () => signInFormBloc,
    );
    ```

* **`ThemeCubit`:** This Cubit manages the current theme of the application. It's also registered as a lazy singleton.
    ```dart
    final themeCubit = ThemeCubit();
    locator.registerLazySingleton(
      () => themeCubit,
    );
    ```


**Benefits of Dependency Injection:**

* **Testability:** Easy to mock dependencies for unit testing.
* **Maintainability:** Changes in one part of the application have less impact on other parts.
* **Reusability:**  Dependencies can be reused in different parts of the application.
* **Scalability:** Helps manage large and complex applications.
