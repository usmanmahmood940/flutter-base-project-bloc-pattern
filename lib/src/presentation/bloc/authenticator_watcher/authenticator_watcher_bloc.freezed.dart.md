### Overview 

This code is auto-generated by Freezed and defines the events and states for an Authenticator Watcher Bloc.  The bloc is responsible for monitoring the authentication status of a user and updating the UI accordingly. 

**Key Features:**

* **Freezed-powered Code Generation:** The code is generated using the Freezed package, providing immutable data structures and pattern matching capabilities.
* **Event-Driven Architecture:** The bloc uses events to trigger state changes, enabling a clean and reactive approach to managing authentication logic.
* **Distinct States:** The bloc defines a set of distinct states to represent the various authentication states (initial, authenticating, authenticated, unauthenticated, first time).

### Events 

The Authenticator Watcher Bloc handles the following events:

| Event Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `authCheckRequest` |  This event is triggered to check the current authentication status.  This is typically called when the application starts. |
| `signOut` |  This event is triggered to sign the user out of the application. |

### States

The Authenticator Watcher Bloc can transition to the following states:

| State Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `initial` | The initial state of the bloc, representing a state before any authentication checks have been made. |
| `authenticating` | This state indicates that the bloc is currently in the process of checking the authentication status. |
| `authenticated` | This state indicates that the user is successfully authenticated. |
| `unauthenticated` | This state indicates that the user is not authenticated. |
| `isFirstTime` | This state indicates that the user is accessing the application for the first time. |
