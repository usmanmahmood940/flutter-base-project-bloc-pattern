| `LOGO` | Path to the application logo image. |

**Code:**

```dart
// ignore_for_file: constant_identifier_names

class Images {
  // static const String LOGO = 'assets/images/logo.png';
  static const String LOGO = 'assets/images/logo.png';
}
```

**Notes:**

* The `// ignore_for_file: constant_identifier_names` directive is used to suppress linting warnings about the use of uppercase variable names for constants. This is a common practice in Flutter development.
* The `LOGO` constant is defined with a path to the application logo image. This path assumes the image is located within the `assets/images` folder of the project. 
* It's important to ensure that the image file actually exists at the specified path. 
* Consider using a more descriptive variable name if it's not immediately clear what the image represents. For example, `APP_LOGO` or `COMPANY_LOGO` might be more descriptive.
