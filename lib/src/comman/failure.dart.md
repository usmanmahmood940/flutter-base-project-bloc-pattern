## Failure Handling in Dart

This document details the implementation of a failure handling strategy in Dart using the `Equatable` package.

### Introduction 

This code implements a robust failure handling mechanism for Dart applications. It defines an abstract `Failure` class and several concrete subclasses that represent different types of failures that can occur in your application. This strategy allows for:

- **Clear Error Identification:**  Each failure type is clearly defined, making it easier to debug and handle errors appropriately.
- **Structured Error Handling:** The use of `Equatable` ensures that failures can be compared and matched easily, enabling you to write more concise and targeted error handling logic.

### Failure Class

The `Failure` class is the base class for all failure types.

```dart
import 'package:equatable/equatable.dart';

abstract class Failure extends Equatable {
  const Failure(this.message);
  final String message;

  @override
  List<Object> get props => [message];
}
```

- **`abstract class Failure extends Equatable`:** This defines an abstract class named `Failure` that inherits from `Equatable`. This means that `Failure` cannot be directly instantiated but serves as a template for concrete failure types.
- **`const Failure(this.message);`:** This constructor initializes the `message` property of the `Failure` object, providing a human-readable description of the failure. 
- **`final String message;`:** This field stores the error message associated with the failure.
- **`@override List<Object> get props => [message];`:** This method is part of the `Equatable` mixin and defines the properties used for comparing `Failure` instances.  

### Failure Subclasses

The code defines four concrete subclasses of `Failure`, each representing a specific failure type:

| Failure Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `ServerFailure` | Represents an error that occurred on the server side. |
| `ConnectionFailure` | Indicates a failure in establishing a connection (e.g., network issue). |
| `DatabaseFailure` | Signifies an error related to database operations. |
| `CacheFailure` |  Represents a failure related to caching mechanisms. | 

**Example Code:**

```dart
class ServerFailure extends Failure {
  const ServerFailure(String message) : super(message);
}
```

- **`class ServerFailure extends Failure`:** This defines a concrete failure type called `ServerFailure` which extends the `Failure` class.
- **`const ServerFailure(String message) : super(message);`:** The constructor of `ServerFailure` simply calls the superclass constructor (the `Failure` constructor) to pass the error message.

**Benefits of this Approach:**

- **Code Clarity:** The use of subclasses makes the code more organized and easier to read. 
- **Error Specific Handling:** You can implement specific error handling logic based on the type of failure using `switch` statements or pattern matching:

```dart
switch (failure) {
  case ServerFailure():
    // Handle server-related errors
    break;
  case ConnectionFailure():
    // Handle connection errors
    break;
  // ... other cases
}
```

- **Testability:**  The clear separation of failure types makes your code more testable as you can easily mock different failure scenarios.
