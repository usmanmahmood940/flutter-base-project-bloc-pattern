### Overview

This code snippet defines an enumeration (enum) called `RequestState`, which represents the various states of a network request. 

```python
b'enum RequestState { empty, loading, error, loaded }'
```

### Enum Members

| Member | Description |
|---|---|
| `empty` |  The request hasn't been initiated yet. ‚è≥ |
| `loading` | The request is currently in progress. üîÑ |
| `error` | An error occurred during the request. ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| `loaded` | The request has successfully completed. ‚úÖ |

This enum is useful for managing the UI state of an application based on the status of a network request. For example, you might use the following logic:

* When the request state is `empty`, display a placeholder or loading indicator.
* When the request state is `loading`, display a loading indicator.
* When the request state is `error`, display an error message.
* When the request state is `loaded`, display the data from the successful request.

This ensures that the user interface accurately reflects the current state of the request, providing a better user experience.
